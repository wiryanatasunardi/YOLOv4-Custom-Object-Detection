# YOLOv4-Tiny Custom Object Detection

YOLOv4 is a series of additions to computer vision techniques that are known to work with a few small novel contributions. The main contribution is to discover how all these techniques can be combined to effectively and efficiently play off one another for object detection. All of the YOLO models are object detection models. Object detection models are trained to look at an image and search for a subset of object classes. When found, these object classes are enclosed in a bounding box, and their class is identified. Object detection models are typically trained and evaluated on the COCO dataset, which contains a broad range of 80 object classes. From there, it is assumed that object detection models will generalize to new object detection tasks if they are exposed to further training data.
